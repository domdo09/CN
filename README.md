## Project Description
Group project focused on capturing, analyzing and validating Internet traffic generated by mobile devices.
The processing follows several stages: in an first phase, traffic was generated using mobile applications on Android terminals and was captured through special capture systems by exploiting a toolchain provided by the ARCLAB laboratory (located inside the University of Naples - "Federico II "). The next phase concerns the classification of the traffic and the analysis of the results, which was done through the development of a special bash script (running on a Linux virtual machine) that automates the procedures.
